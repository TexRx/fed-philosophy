=======================

Best Practices
Setting Up Projects
Provide ALL documentation within the project. High level or all detail documentation should be stored in README.md
Site Setup Instructions
Start to finish working development environment instructions
Build script instructions (if included)
Browser Support
List all browsers support. Support Browser List Includes:
IE 9+
Chrome 20+
Firefox 7+
iOS 6+ Mobile Safari
Android 4.x+ Browser
Android Chrome Browser (Latest)
Safari 6.0.1 + (OSX Only) (Optional)
Confirm with Account Manager. Get Exact Specs.
Technologies (Client Layer)
SCSS 3.3+
Angular JS 1.2.16+
Be careful with Angular. 1.2.16 is IE8+, 1.3 IE9+
jQuery 1.11.0
If using Angular JS and supporting IE9, ONLY USE JQUERY FOR DOM MANIPULATION, ie as a CSS3 Fallback!
Font Awesome (4.x) IE8+
see https://bitbucket.org/onenorth/torys-com-client for a great set of instructions
Continuous Integration
Work In Progress
Jenkins vs Azure Build
GIT Everything
gitignore
compiled css/javascript
config files
IDE settings
Project Directory Tree
IDES
Netbeans vs. Sublime
We don’t discriminate by text editor, IDE’s can potentially save time and money. 
Nomenclature
CSS/HTML

Javascript
Recommendations
Use popular technologies. Going rogue will only hurt you in the long run.
Gulp, Grunt, Coffeescript, Sass, etc.
Maintainability
Follow Previous Developer’s Philosophy
If there’s an opportunity to improve that is low effort/cost: Improve it!
Develop under the assumption that you won’t be the only one maintaining the code base.
