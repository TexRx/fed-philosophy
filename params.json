{"name":"ONE NORTH","tagline":"Front End Developer Guide","body":"# Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is the most important step and is required for every build. It doesn't take more than 15 minutes and it's great to lay out your toolkit so there are no surprises later on in the build. Get this out of the way, first. Make changes as you go along.\r\n\r\nTLDR; Categories Required:\r\n- Browser Support\r\n- Technologies Used\r\n- Compatibility Notes\r\n- Environment Setup Instructions \r\n- Dependencies Used\r\n- Additional Notes/Information\r\n\r\n## Browser Support\r\n\r\nProvide **all** documentation within the project.\r\n\r\n**Most projects will be IE9+**\r\n- Check to make sure - don't shoot yourself in the foot by going with an IE9+ utility only to realize you need IE8 support\r\n\r\n**List out complete browser support inside the README.md**\r\n- If you're not sure about something, ask your account manager to **send you an email**.\r\n- There is a difference between Chrome on an IPhone and Android. There are differences between Android Phones, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Currently Supported Browsers:\r\n- IE 9+ \r\n- Chrome 20+\r\n- Firefox 7+\r\n- iOS 6+ Mobile Safari\r\n- Android 4.x+ Browser\r\n- Android Chrome Browser (Edge)\r\n- Safari 6+ (OSX)\r\n\r\n## Technologies \r\n\r\nList out the utilities / frameworks you're going to be using for the project. If there are any issues, or technologies in question, list these under compatibility notes.\r\n\r\n- SCSS 3.3+ (Ruby)\r\n- Angular JS 1.3+ (IE9+)\r\n- jQuery 1.10.0 (_see compatibility notes_)\r\n- Font Awesome (4.2.1) (IE9+)\r\n\r\n## Compatibility Notes \r\n\r\nIf there is something that doesn't fall under an assumption, list it here\r\n\r\n## Environment Setup\r\n\r\n### Development Dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself using a specific toolset for your development environment, make sure to list it here. If you're using a package.json file and/or bower.json, run ```npm shrinkwrap``` to lock in the version of whatever project you're using.\r\n\r\nList your dev dependecies that you've got inside your package.json / bower.json. Run ```npm shrinkwrap``` before you're done to lock in the correct version. There will be times where a project will break if dependencies do not have a correct version number. Bower does not currently have this implemented but will soon [Bower Issue #1362](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/1362)\r\n\r\n### Common Development Dependencies\r\n- Node\r\n- Grunt (task runner)\r\n- Gulp ( new task runner)\r\n- SCSS ( css pre-compiler)\r\n- Bower (package dependency manager)\r\n- Jasmin\r\n- Karma\r\n\r\n## Getting Up and Running\r\n\r\nAny commands that require execution\r\n\r\n- ```npm install```\r\n- ```bower install```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Project Scaffold\r\nWe store everything on GIT, so make sure you set up a bitbucket repo and upload everything there. \r\n- Project Directory Tree should mimic what the industry does for JS projects\r\n- Use a *real* IDE. Although we shouldn’t discriminate by text editor, IDEs that save time and money are what business owners are looking for. The greater industry of development also appreciates everyone knowing the top tier IDEs.\r\n\t- Netbeans vs Sublime\r\n\r\n# GIT Early, GIT Often\r\nWe cannot stress this enough. GIT After Every:\r\n- Module\r\n- Component\r\n- Feature\r\n- 10 LOC (as an extreme example)\r\n\r\n## DO NOT commit after a full day's of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [Yeoman::Angular::Grunt](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)\r\n- [Yeoman::Angular::Gulp](https://github.com/henyojess/generator-gulp-ng) **\r\n\r\n## Directory Structure\r\n<pre>\r\n\tapp/\r\n\t\timages/\r\n\t\tscripts/\r\n\t\t\tmain.js\r\n\t\t\tconfig.js\r\n\t\t\tcontrollers/\r\n\t\t\tconstants/\r\n\t\t\tdirectives/\r\n\t\t\tenums/\r\n\t\t\tfilters/\r\n\t\t\tservices/\r\n\t\tscss/\r\n\t\t\tcore/\r\n\t\t\tdeps/\r\n\t\t\tcomponents/\r\n\t\t\ttheme/\r\n\t\tviews/\r\n\t\t\tindex.html\r\n\tpackage.json\r\n\tbower_components\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Consistent Nomenclature\r\n- CSS / HTML\r\n  - https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml\r\n  - BEM, SMACSS, or similar naming conventions\r\n    - global-header, bio , bio-image, bio-image-small\r\n- Javascript\r\n  - https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml\r\n  - https://github.com/airbnb/javascript\r\n\r\n## Recommendations\r\n- Use popular technologies. Going rogue will only cause problems for new devs on a project and could cause potential problems when doing research\r\n  - SCSS\r\n  - Yeoman\r\n  - Coffeescript\r\n  - Angular JS\r\n  \r\n## Maintainability\r\n- Follow existing standards\r\n  - If there’s an opportunity to improve that is a low effort/cost: Improve it\r\n  - Develope under the assumption you are not the one maintaining the code base\r\n\r\n## Modulization of CSS/JS/HTML\r\nSee /examples folder \r\n\r\n### Component Principles to Follow\r\n\r\n- Components should be self contained\r\n- Components should do one thing very well\r\n- Should reuse other components as much as possible\r\n- Components should be extensible\r\n- Components can be defined at any degree\r\n  - e.g.: Responsive Wrapper, Header, navigation, primary button\r\n- **Use Bower to Handle Components when possible** see .bowerrc, bower.json\r\n\r\n## Time Estimation\r\n- Reconnaissance\r\n\t- Gathering Information about a Project\r\n\t- The more details about the Project the better, assumptions create risk\r\n- Company evaluation\r\n\t- Business Evaluation\r\n\t\t- Business\r\n\t\t\t- how many hours have been predefined?
